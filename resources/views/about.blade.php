        <p>I write and teach about the past: specifically, the politics and culture of 19th and 20th century Britain and Ireland. I love novels of all kinds, especially detective fiction. I am passionate about using new digital tools to make history ever more vibrant and accessible. And I believe in the power of writing to transform society.</p>
        <p>I have a Ph.D. in history from Brown University and an S.B. from M.I.T. My work has been published by Cambridge University Press, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The Toast</i>, among other places.</p>
        <p>I have taught undergraduates at Harvard University, Clark University, and Brown University, and I was awarded the John Clive Prize for Excellence in Teaching in History and Literature (2011) and the Derek Bok Centre Certificate for Excellence in Teaching (2015).</p>
